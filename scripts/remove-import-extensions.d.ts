/**
 * Extension Removal Script for TypeScript Imports
 *
 * This script removes file extensions from all import and export statements
 * to standardize the codebase import pattern.
 *
 * It handles:
 * - Static imports: import { X } from './path.ts' -> import { X } from './path'
 * - Dynamic imports: await import('./path') -> await import('./path')
 * - Re-exports: export * from './path.ts' -> export * from './path'
 * - Named exports: export { X } from './path.ts' -> export { X } from './path'
