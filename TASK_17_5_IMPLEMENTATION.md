# Task 17.5: Analysis Engine Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the Analysis Engine component for Task-Code Relationship Tracking.

## Overview

The Analysis Engine analyzes file content and paths to find relationships with tasks in the system. It extracts task IDs, calculates confidence scores, determines relationship types, and provides an API for the daemon to use these relationships.

## Key Features

1. **Task ID Extraction**:
   - Pattern matching for task IDs in various formats (Task-123, #123)
   - Extraction from file content and file paths
   - Location tracking for matches (line and column)

2. **Confidence Scoring**:
   - Heuristic-based confidence calculation
   - Context-aware scoring
   - Threshold-based filtering

3. **Relationship Type Determination**:
   - Implements, tests, documents, related type classification
   - Content-based type inference
   - File type as a factor in relationship determination

4. **File Classification**:
   - Code, test, documentation, build, config, other categorization
   - Extension and content-based classification
   - Support for common file types

5. **NLP Enhancement**:
   - Task title/description matching
   - Keyword analysis for task relevance
   - Content similarity scoring

6. **Integration with File Tracking**:
   - Seamless integration with file tracking daemon
   - Batch processing support
   - Task association management

## Implementation Details

- **File Content Analysis**: The engine analyzes file content using regex patterns and contextual analysis to find task references.
- **Path Analysis**: File and directory names are analyzed for embedded task IDs.
- **Confidence Calculation**: A sophisticated scoring system determines how strongly a file is related to a task.
- **Relationship Classification**: The engine determines the nature of the relationship between a file and a task.
- **Exclusion Support**: Configurable patterns for excluding files from analysis.
- **Extension Filtering**: Support for focusing on specific file types.

## Usage

The Analysis Engine is used by the File Tracking Daemon to automatically associate files with tasks:

```typescript
// Initialize the engine with a repository and configuration
const analysisEngine = new AnalysisEngine(repository, {
  confidenceThreshold: 70,
  fileExtensions: ['.ts', '.js', '.md'],
  exclusionPatterns: ['node_modules', 'dist']
});

// Analyze a file change
const result = await analysisEngine.analyzeFileChange({
  type: 'change',
  path: '/path/to/file.ts'
});

// Use the analysis results
if (result && result.taskMatches.length > 0) {
  await analysisEngine.associateFilesWithTasks(result);
}
```

## Testing

Comprehensive tests have been implemented to verify the engine's functionality:

- Task ID extraction tests
- Confidence scoring tests
- Relationship type determination tests
- File path analysis tests
- Exclusion pattern tests
- Batch processing tests

## Future Enhancements

1. Improved NLP integration for better task matching
2. Machine learning-based confidence scoring
3. Support for more file types and languages
4. Performance optimization for large repositories
