# Task Master Test Coverage

This document outlines the test coverage for the Task Master CLI application.

## Current Test Coverage

### Core Components

| Module       | Test File                    | Coverage Status |
|--------------|------------------------------|----------------|
| graph.ts     | graph.test.ts                | Good - 3 tests covering core functionality |
| repo.ts      | repo.test.ts                 | Good - 4 tests covering basic CRUD operations |
| repo.ts      | repo-advanced-simple.test.ts | Good - Tests for advanced functionality added in latest sprints |

### CLI Commands

| Command      | Test File                    | Coverage Status |
|--------------|------------------------------|----------------|
| metadata     | metadata-simple.test.ts      | Basic functionality tested |
| api          | api-simple.test.ts           | Basic functionality tested |
| next         | next-simple.test.ts          | Basic functionality tested |

## New Tests Added

1. **Metadata Command Tests**
   - Tests for get, set, remove, and append operations
   - Tests for JSON metadata support
   - Tests for both JSON and text output formats

2. **API Command Tests**
   - Tests for export functionality with multiple formats
   - Tests for import functionality with validation
   - Tests for batch operations

3. **Next Command Tests**
   - Tests for retrieving single and multiple next tasks
   - Tests for various filtering options
   - Tests for JSON output format

4. **Advanced Repository Tests**
   - Tests for NLP-based search functionality
   - Tests for similarity detection and deduplication
   - Tests for metadata operations
   - Tests for dependency reordering during deletion
   - Tests for multiple next tasks retrieval

## Test Implementation Approach

The testing strategy used includes:

1. **Unit Tests**: Focused on testing individual functions and methods
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing how components work together
3. **Fixture-Based Testing**: Using in-memory SQLite databases for testing
4. **Console Output Capture**: For testing CLI command output

## Next Steps for Improving Test Coverage

1. **Command Tests**: Improve test coverage for remaining commands (add, remove, update, search, show)
2. **Edge Cases**: Add more tests for edge cases and error handling
3. **Integration Testing**: Add more integration tests for end-to-end workflows
4. **Test Helpers**: Further develop test helpers for common testing patterns
