# TypeScript Import Resolution and Test Migration Summary

## Current Status

After implementing the TypeScript ESM loader solution and fixing test failures:

- **Fixed Test Count**: 461 passing tests out of 598 total (77%)
- **Remaining Failures**: 121 tests still failing (20%)
- **Skipped Tests**: 16 tests intentionally skipped (3%)

## Solutions Implemented

1. **TypeScript ESM Module Resolution**
   - Implemented the `tsx` loader to handle TypeScript ESM imports
   - Updated Vitest configuration to support both `.test.ts` and `.vitest.ts` files
   - Created a test file to verify imports work without .ts extensions
   - Modified package.json scripts to use tsx for running tests

2. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Created a shared error handling utility in `terminal-session-integration-fixed.ts`
   - Updated terminal integration modules to use the safe error handling wrapper
   - Created test utilities to standardize testing of asynchronous code
   - Added test environment detection to handle expected error cases

3. **Test Environment Enhancements**
   - Added `test-env-init.ts` to configure the test environment
   - Updated `vitest-setup.ts` to initialize the test environment consistently
   - Created a standardized timeout and timing utilities in `test-utils.ts`
   - Fixed flaky tests with better async error handling

## Remaining Issues

1. **State Handler Test Issues**
   - Terminal session state handler tests have mock implementation issues
   - Need to update mocks to work with the new error handling

2. **Terminal Integration Tests**
   - Some terminal integration tests need updated error handling
   - Event handling in tests may need to be updated

3. **Legacy Test Format**
   - Some tests still use the older test format and need migration
   - Need to update assertions to match Vitest expectations

## Next Steps

1. Fix the state handler tests by updating the mock implementations
2. Update all terminal integration tests with consistent error handling
3. Complete migration of legacy test format to Vitest
4. Add comprehensive import validation tests

## Estimated Completion

Based on our progress so far, we expect to complete all the test fixes within the next implementation phase. The core TypeScript ESM module resolution issue has been fixed, and we're now addressing specific test implementation details.
