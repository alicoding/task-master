   - ✅ Unit tests for core functionality

## Current Progress

We've recently completed:

1. **Type Safety Enhancement**
   - Added `TaskOperationResult<T>` interface for structured error handling
   - Implemented `TaskError` class and `TaskErrorCode` enum for typed errors
   - Added type guards (`isTaskStatus`, `isTaskReadiness`) for runtime validation
   - Enhanced `/core/types.ts` with proper interfaces and type definitions
   - Added validation functions for metadata and other inputs

2. **Repository Layer Improvements**
   - Enhanced `BaseTaskRepository` with proper error handling patterns
   - Updated methods to use `TaskOperationResult<T>` return type
   - Added legacy methods for backward compatibility (e.g., `getTaskLegacy`)
   - Improved input validation in repository methods
   - Enhanced `RepositoryFactory` with proper typing and error handling
   - Updated `TaskSearchRepository` with new error handling pattern
   - Enhanced `TaskHierarchyRepository` with proper error handling
   - Improved `TaskCreationRepository` with robust error handling and validation

3. **CLI Commands Update**
   - Updated `ai` command to use the `TaskOperationResult` pattern
   - Updated `show` command to handle structured results
   - Enhanced error handling in `show graph` command
   - Updated `TaskGraph` class to use structured error handling

4. **Task-Code Relationship Tracking System Setup**
   - ✅ Created detailed implementation plan with task hierarchy
   - ✅ Added implementation tasks to Task Master (dogfooding)
   - ✅ Set up parent-child relationships and proper task IDs
   - ✅ Added descriptive tags for better categorization

5. **Fixed Task Creation Issues**
   - ✅ Corrected issues with parentId field name
   - ✅ Fixed dependency relationship creation
   - ✅ Improved error handling in task creation
   - ✅ Enhanced SQL queries for child task ID generation

## Current Issues

1. **TypeScript Compilation Errors**
   - Several TypeScript errors related to the new error handling pattern:
     - Errors when accessing properties on TaskOperationResult objects
     - Issues with indexing in chalk types and arrays
     - Type errors in test files when using the new patterns

2. **Test Suite Challenges**
   - TaskSearchRepository integration tests need proper mocking for NLP operations
   - Many tests are affected by the new error handling pattern
   - Need to update tests to work with the TaskOperationResult pattern
   - Update mock implementations to use the correct interface

3. **CLI Command Integration**
   - Several CLI commands still need to be updated to work with the new error handling
   - Need to implement proper error display and user feedback
   - Update command handlers to handle TaskOperationResult patterns

4. **ESM Module Issues**
   - Fixed top-level await issues in formatters using Promise-based initialization
   - Some modules still have issues with dynamic imports and ESM compatibility

## Next Steps

1. **CLI Command Layer Updates**
   - Update remaining CLI commands to use the new error handling pattern:
     - add, update, remove, search, metadata, and deduplicate commands
   - Implement proper error display for typed errors
   - Add user-friendly error messages with actionable guidance

2. **Fix TypeScript Errors**
   - Address errors related to chalk indexing and array access
   - Fix errors in test files to work with TaskOperationResult
   - Update mock implementations to match the new interfaces
   - Fix type errors in the remaining CLI commands

3. **Implement Task-Code Relationship Tracking System**
   - Begin implementation of daemon process (Task 17.1)
   - Create file system watcher module (Task 17.2)
   - Extend database schema for file tracking (Task 17.3)
   - Develop analysis engine for file-task relationships (Task 17.5)

4. **Further Test Coverage Enhancement**
   - Update existing tests to work with the new TaskOperationResult pattern
   - Add tests for all CLI commands with the new error handling
   - Update integration tests to work with the new architecture
   - Create mock implementations for NLP and other services

5. **Documentation and Type Safety**
   - Update API documentation to reflect new error handling pattern
   - Document the TaskOperationResult pattern and usage guidelines
   - Add JSDoc comments to all methods using the new pattern
   - Create examples showing proper error handling

## Feature Backlog

- Task-Code Relationship Tracking System (in progress)
- Data visualization features
- Task scheduling and calendar integration
- Multi-user collaboration capabilities
- Remote/cloud sync capabilities
- Import/export to standard formats (CSV, etc.)

## Technical Debt

- **Error Handling**: Continue adapting CLI commands to work with the new TaskOperationResult pattern
- **Type Definitions**: Continue eliminating 'any' types throughout the codebase
- **Test Coverage**: Many components still lack comprehensive test coverage
- **Logging**: Consider using a proper logging framework instead of console.log
- **CLI Command Structure**: Some command files are becoming complex and need refactoring
- **Database Schema**: Evaluate schema for potential improvements and strong typing
- **ESM Compatibility**: Fix remaining ESM module compatibility issues with dynamic imports
