# Task Master Project Status

## Completed Tasks

1. Core Functionality
   - ✅ Task Repository implementation (CRUD operations)
   - ✅ Task Graph implementation (hierarchy visualization)
   - ✅ CLI command structure setup with Commander.js

2. Extended Features
   - ✅ Dependency reordering when tasks are deleted
   - ✅ Batch JSON updates
   - ✅ NLP search capabilities
   - ✅ Deduplication prompts
   - ✅ JSON format across commands
   - ✅ Metadata functionality
   - ✅ Roo integration (API commands)
   - ✅ Unit tests for core functionality

## Current Progress

We've recently completed:
- Implementation of metadata command for managing task metadata
- Implementation of API commands for Roo integration
- Enhancement of search with NLP capabilities
- Implementation of JSON output format across commands
- Initial test coverage for new features
- Code refactoring to keep files under 300 lines:
  - Split repository into modular components
  - Split API command into separate command files
  - Added JSDoc comments for better documentation

## Current Issues

There are issues with the repository refactoring that need to be fixed:
- Tests are failing after refactoring the TaskRepository and API command
- The issue appears to be related to how the repository instances are created and managed
- We need to fix these issues to ensure backward compatibility

## Next Steps

1. Fix Refactoring Issues
   - Fix the TaskRepository refactoring to pass all tests
   - Ensure proper delegation to specialized repositories
   - Update tests to work with the new architecture

2. Code Cleanup and Documentation
   - Review all files to ensure they're under 300 lines
   - Add JSDoc comments to all public methods
   - Create user documentation for all commands

3. Additional Testing
   - Complete test coverage for remaining commands
   - Add integration tests for common workflows
   - Ensure tests run correctly with the new architecture

4. Performance and Usability
   - Optimize database queries
   - Improve error handling and user feedback
   - Add progress indicators for long-running operations

## Feature Backlog

- Data visualization features
- Task scheduling and calendar integration
- Multi-user collaboration capabilities
- Remote/cloud sync capabilities
- Import/export to standard formats (CSV, etc.)

## Technical Debt

- Some command files are becoming complex and may need refactoring
- Consider using a proper logging framework instead of console.log
- Evaluate database schema for potential improvements
