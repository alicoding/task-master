# Task 17: Task-Code Relationship Tracker Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Task-Code Relationship Tracker (Task 17) which provides functionality to track relationships between tasks and code files. The feature allows automatic detection of code changes and associates them with relevant tasks.

## Completed Tasks

### Task 17.1: Daemon Process Implementation ✅

Implemented a background daemon process for file monitoring that:
- Runs in the background to track file changes
- Provides a clean API for starting, stopping, and checking status
- Uses events to communicate file changes and task associations
- Includes proper cleanup and signal handling
- Supports both interactive and detached modes

### Task 17.2: File System Watcher ✅

Implemented a file system watcher module using Chokidar that:
- Detects file creation, modification, deletion, and renaming
- Supports filtering by file path and extension
- Provides debouncing and batching of file change events
- Normalizes file system events into a consistent format
- Calculates file hashes for detecting real content changes
- Efficiently handles large numbers of files and rapid changes

### Task 17.3: Database Extensions ✅

Added database tables and queries for file tracking:
- Created `files` table for tracking file information
- Created `task_files` table for many-to-many relationships between tasks and files
- Created `file_changes` table for tracking the history of file changes
- Implemented repository methods for file tracking operations
- Added support for associating files with tasks with confidence scores
- Added support for querying files by task and tasks by file

### Task 17.4: CLI Integration ✅

Integrated the daemon and file tracking with the CLI:
- Added `daemon` command with subcommands for managing the daemon
- Implemented commands for starting, stopping, and checking daemon status
- Added commands for file-task association management
- Provided detailed help text and examples for all commands
- Added support for customizing daemon behavior through command-line options
- Created comprehensive tests for CLI integration

## Key Features

1. **Auto-Association**: Automatically associates files with tasks based on content analysis
2. **Confidence Scoring**: Calculates confidence scores for file-task associations
3. **File Change Tracking**: Records all file changes with timestamps and hashes
4. **Flexible Filtering**: Supports filtering by file path, extension, and other criteria
5. **Relationship Types**: Classifies relationships as "implements", "tests", "documents", or "related"
6. **Daemon Management**: Provides commands for starting, stopping, and checking daemon status
7. **Daemon Configuration**: Allows customization of daemon behavior through command-line options

## Usage Examples

### Starting the Daemon

```bash
# Start the daemon with default settings
tm daemon start

# Start the daemon with custom settings
tm daemon start --path ./src --exclude node_modules,.git --auto-associate --confidence 80
```

### Checking Daemon Status

```bash
# Check basic status
tm daemon status

# Check detailed status
tm daemon status --verbose
```

### Associating Files with Tasks

```bash
# Manually associate a file with a task
tm daemon associate --file ./src/app.js --task 123 --relationship implements

# List files associated with a task
tm daemon files --task 123

# List tasks associated with a file
tm daemon tasks --file ./src/app.js
```

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests:
- Unit tests for the file system watcher
- Unit tests for the file tracking repository
- Integration tests for CLI commands

## Next Steps

Future enhancements could include:
- More sophisticated analysis of file content for better auto-association
- Visual representation of task-code relationships
- Code change metrics and statistics
- Integration with version control systems
- Enhanced file change notifications
