## Tasks Completed

### Task 19 & 20: Fix JSON Metadata Display Bug
- Identified issue in `TaskMetadataRepository` class where it wasn't correctly handling the `TaskOperationResult` pattern
- Fixed `getMetadata` and `getMetadataField` methods to properly extract data from `TaskOperationResult`
- Added support for nested field access using dot notation in `getMetadataField`
- Verified functionality with both test task 19 and 20 metadata display

### Task 2.8: Write Unit Tests for Uncovered Logic
- Created comprehensive TypeScript tests for metadata handling:
  - `test/core/metadata-repository.test.ts`: Tests for TaskMetadataRepository
  - `test/commands/metadata-command.test.ts`: Tests for CLI metadata commands
- Tests cover all metadata operations:
  - Getting single and nested metadata fields
  - Setting new and updating existing fields
  - Removing fields
  - Appending to array fields
  - Proper error handling

### Task 14: Test Adding a New Task
- Created example file `examples/add-task-examples.ts` demonstrating various task creation scenarios
- Documented CLI usage for:
  - Basic task creation
  - Adding tasks with description, status, and tags
  - Creating parent-child relationships
  - Adding structured metadata
  - Using command options like --force, --dry-run, etc.
- Verified functionality by successfully adding a test task via CLI

## Technical Challenges Faced

1. **Database Schema Issues**: Had to deal with differences between the test database schema and the actual schema.
2. **Test Framework Integration**: Faced challenges with the test environments and configuration.
3. **Error Handling Patterns**: Properly handled the TaskOperationResult pattern for error management.
4. **Nested Metadata Access**: Implemented dot notation support for accessing nested metadata fields.

## Improvement Areas

1. **Test Environment**: Improve test setup to better match production environment.
2. **Error Handling**: Enhance error messages to be more descriptive.
3. **Documentation**: More comprehensive API documentation could benefit users.

## Next Steps

As per the plan, the next steps should be:
1. Task 17.3: Database Extensions for tracking file changes
2. Task 17.1: Daemon Process Implementation
3. Task 17.2: File System Watcher

## Technical Debt

- JavaScript files created for testing should be converted to TypeScript
- Created task #26 to track this conversion

# Session Summary - 2025-05-10

## Tasks Completed

1. **Code Refactoring**
   - Split the `TaskRepository` class into modular components
     - Created specialized repositories for different aspects (base, creation, search, metadata, hierarchy)
     - Implemented delegation pattern for the main repository
     - Added JSDoc comments for better documentation
   - Refactored the API command into separate files
     - Split each subcommand (export, import, batch) into its own file
     - Updated the main command to use the modular structure
   - Kept all files under 300 lines for better maintainability

2. **Documentation**
   - Created `PROJECT_STATUS.md` to track overall project progress
   - Created `REPOSITORY.md` to document the repository architecture
   - Created `API_COMMAND.md` to document the API command structure
   - Created `REFACTORING_FIX_PLAN.md` to plan fixes for refactoring issues
   - Updated `TEST_COVERAGE.md` with details on test coverage

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Test Failures**
   - Tests are failing after the refactoring
   - Issues with database connection management in specialized repositories
   - Delegation pattern needs improvement to ensure proper parameter passing

2. **Architecture Complexity**
   - The modular architecture introduces more complexity
   - Need to ensure specialized repositories work together correctly
   - Need to maintain backward compatibility

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Refactoring Issues**
   - Implement the repository factory pattern
   - Add legacy mode for backward compatibility
   - Update specialized repositories to share database connections
   - Fix delegation issues in the main repository

2. **Continue Testing Improvements**
   - Update tests to work with the new architecture
   - Fix failing tests
   - Complete test coverage for commands

3. **Documentation**
   - Complete user documentation for all commands
   - Add more JSDoc comments to methods

## Code Quality Improvements

- All refactored files now follow the 300-line limit
- Added JSDoc comments to document functionality
- Better separation of concerns with specialized repositories
- Improved modularity in the API command structure

## Lessons Learned

1. **Refactoring Strategy**
   - Need better planning for refactoring large components
   - Should implement and test changes incrementally
   - Important to maintain backward compatibility

2. **Architecture Design**
   - Specialized repositories are a good pattern for separation of concerns
   - Need to carefully manage shared resources like database connections
   - Delegation patterns need thorough testing

3. **Documentation**
   - Documentation should be updated alongside code changes
   - Architecture decisions should be well-documented
   - Plans for fixing issues should be documented for team awareness
