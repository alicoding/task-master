# Task 17.3: Database Extensions for Tracking File Changes - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Task 17.3 has been successfully implemented, providing a database schema and repository layer for tracking file changes and their relationships with tasks. This is part of the larger Task-Code Relationship Tracking System (Task 17).

## Implemented Components

1. **Database Schema Extensions**
   - Created three new tables in the database:
     - `files`: For tracking file information (path, hash, type, etc.)
     - `task_files`: For managing many-to-many relationships between tasks and files
     - `file_changes`: For logging file change history
   - Added appropriate indexes for efficient querying
   - Created migration script to add these tables to the database

2. **Repository Implementation**
   - Created a new `FileTrackingRepository` class with methods for:
     - Tracking files and detecting changes
     - Associating files with tasks with different relationship types
     - Getting files associated with a task
     - Getting tasks associated with a file
     - Retrieving file change history
   - Added a file hash calculation system using SHA-256
   - Integrated the repository with the main `TaskRepository` class

3. **Testing**
   - Created a comprehensive test script to verify all functionality
   - Tests tracking files and detecting changes
   - Tests associating files with tasks
   - Tests retrieving task-file relationships
   - Tests retrieving file change history

4. **Documentation**
   - Created detailed documentation in `FILE_TRACKING.md`
   - Documented the database schema
   - Documented the API and usage examples
   - Explained integration with the daemon process

## Technical Details

### Database Schema

The database schema follows a well-structured approach:

1. `files` table stores information about tracked files with a unique index on file paths to prevent duplicates.
2. `task_files` table implements a many-to-many relationship between tasks and files, with a relationship type and confidence score.
3. `file_changes` table logs each change to a file with timestamps and hash values for change detection.

### File Tracking

The system tracks files by:

1. Reading the file content
2. Calculating a SHA-256 hash
3. Storing file information in the database
4. Detecting changes by comparing hashes
5. Recording change history

### Task-File Relationships

The system supports different types of relationships:
- `implements`: The file implements the task
- `tests`: The file contains tests for the task
- `documents`: The file documents the task
- `related`: The file is related to the task

Each relationship also has a confidence score (0-100) for auto-detected relationships.

## Next Steps

This task completes the database extension component of the Task-Code Relationship Tracking System. The next steps are:

1. Task 17.1: Implement Daemon Process to run in the background and monitor file changes
2. Task 17.2: Implement File System Watcher to detect changes to files in the project
3. Integrate all components to provide a complete Task-Code Relationship Tracking System
