# Task-Code Relationship Tracking System

## User Guide

This document provides an overview of the Task-Code Relationship Tracking System - a sophisticated addition to Task Master that automatically monitors, analyzes, and manages relationships between tasks and code, eliminating manual tracking and enhancing developer workflow.

## Overview

The Task Master CLI will be enhanced with a powerful daemon-based monitoring system that tracks which code changes relate to which tasks, automatically suggesting relationships, detecting implementation gaps, and intelligently managing task hierarchies. All of this happens with minimal developer intervention while maintaining full user control.

## Key Features

### Session Tracking

```bash
# Start tracking code changes for a task
tm session start TASK-123

# Multiple concurrent tasks (for different features)
tm session start TASK-456 --priority 2

# Check your active sessions
tm session status

# View changes in real-time
tm session start TASK-123 --tail

# Stop tracking and analyze changes
tm session stop
```

The session tracking system runs as a completely detached daemon that continues running even if your terminal is closed. When you reconnect, Task Master will automatically reconnect to the daemon and show you which sessions are active.

#### Key Benefits:
- Continues tracking even when your terminal closes accidentally
- Visual indicator in your prompt shows when tracking is active
- Automatically times out inactive sessions
- Recovers from system restarts

### Change Analysis

```bash
# Analyze which code files relate to a task
tm session analyze TASK-123

# Find implementation gaps in a task
tm session gaps TASK-123

# Check test coverage for task implementation
tm session coverage TASK-123

# Retroactively assign changes to a task
tm session assign --task TASK-123 --from "2023-06-15 10:00" --to "2023-06-15 15:30"
```

The analysis system uses sophisticated algorithms (enhanced by customizable AI prompts) to determine which files relate to a task, how strongly they're related, and what parts of the task requirements may not be fully implemented yet.

#### Key Benefits:
- Automatically identifies relevant files with confidence scores
- Detects missing implementations based on task requirements
- Finds related tasks that might be affected by changes
- Suggests test coverage improvements

### Multi-Session Support

```bash
# List all active sessions
tm session list

# Assign a file explicitly to a task
tm session claim FILE-PATH --task TASK-123

# Resolve a file conflict between tasks
tm session resolve --conflict 42 --assign TASK-123
```

The multi-session system allows you to work on multiple tasks concurrently, automatically determining which changes belong to which task and providing tools to resolve any ambiguity.

#### Key Benefits:
- Multiple developers can track different tasks simultaneously
- Intelligent change separation between concurrent tasks
- Explicit assignment for ambiguous changes
- Priority system for resolving conflicts

### Task Hierarchy Management

```bash
# Get suggestions for task organization
tm tasks suggest-hierarchy

# Automatically position a new task
tm add --title "New integration task" --auto-position

# Check for missing integration tasks
tm tasks analyze-gaps --integration

# Rename and reposition tasks
tm tasks renumber
```

The hierarchy management system helps organize tasks intelligently based on code analysis, automatically positioning new tasks in the appropriate place in the hierarchy.

#### Key Benefits:
- Automatically detects optimal task positioning
- Renumbers tasks consistently when adding new ones
- Updates references to maintain consistency
- Suggests missing integration tasks

### Customizable AI Prompts

```bash
# List available prompts
tm prompts list

# Edit a prompt
tm prompts edit relationship-detection

# Test a prompt with sample data
tm prompts test gap-analysis --task TASK-123

# Share prompts with your team
tm prompts export relationship-detection
```

The customizable AI prompts system allows you to tailor Task Master's intelligence to your team's specific needs, project domain, and preferred AI models.

#### Key Benefits:
- Customize prompts to work with different AI models
- Optimize prompts for your project domain
- Control token usage and associated costs
- Share effective prompt configurations with your team

## Shell Integration

Task Master can integrate with your shell to provide visual indicators that tracking is active:

```bash
# Install shell integration
tm session install-shell-integration

# After installation, your prompt will show:
username@hostname:~/project$ ðŸ”´ Tracking: TASK-123
```

## Background Recording

Even when you're not explicitly tracking a task, Task Master can record file changes in the background, allowing you to retroactively assign them to tasks later:

```bash
# Enable background recording
tm session enable-background

# View unassigned time windows
tm session windows

# Assign a time window to a task
tm session assign-window --window 42 --task TASK-123
```

## Usage Workflow

### Basic Workflow

1. Start your day by running `tm session start TASK-123`
2. Work normally, editing files as needed
3. When finished, run `tm session stop`
4. Review the analysis and approve any suggested relationships
5. Start on your next task with `tm session start TASK-456`

### Advanced Workflow

1. Use `tm session enable-background` once to enable constant recording
2. Work without explicitly tracking tasks
3. At the end of the day, run `tm session windows` to see your activity
4. Assign time windows to tasks with `tm session assign-window`
5. Review the analysis and approve any suggested relationships

## Technical Notes

- The daemon consumes minimal resources (<1% CPU, minimal memory)
- All data is stored locally in the Task Master database
- Works with any Git repository and any codebase
- Integrates with unit test frameworks to analyze test coverage
- Compatible with all major operating systems and terminal environments

## Conclusion

The Task-Code Relationship Tracking System removes the need for manual task-code tracking, letting you focus on writing code while Task Master automatically builds a rich understanding of your project's tasks and their implementation. By bringing AI-powered analysis to task management, it provides insights that would be impractical to generate manually, all while respecting your workflow and keeping you in control.
