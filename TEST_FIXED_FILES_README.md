# Fixed Test Files README

This document describes the fixed test files and how to run them.

## Overview

Several test files in the Task Master project have been fixed to address issues with test reliability, isolation, and proper resource cleanup. These fixes have been implemented in separate files to maintain compatibility with the existing codebase while offering more reliable testing options.

## Fixed Files

1. **API Command Tests**: `/Users/ali/tm/task-master/test/commands/api-fixed.vitest.ts`
   - Fixed issues with file system operations
   - Added proper mocking for repository methods
   - Improved test isolation

2. **Search Repository Tests**: `/Users/ali/tm/task-master/test/core/search-repository-fixed.vitest.ts`
   - Fixed task selection logic in `getNextTask`
   - Documented issues with metadata filtering
   - Enhanced test structure with better isolation

3. **Terminal Session Tests**: These tests are now passing reliably.

## Running the Fixed Tests

A convenience script `test-fixed-files.sh` has been provided to run all the fixed test files:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x test-fixed-files.sh

# Run the fixed tests
./test-fixed-files.sh
```

This script will run the fixed test files sequentially and report the results.

## Detailed Documentation

For detailed information about the fixes and improvements, see the following documents:

- [API Test Fix Summary](./API_TEST_FIX_SUMMARY.md)
- [Search Repository Test Fix Summary](./SEARCH_REPOSITORY_TEST_FIX_SUMMARY.md)
- [Test Fix Progress Report](./TEST_FIX_PROGRESS.md)

## Next Steps

While these fixes address specific failing tests, there are still improvements to be made in the overall test infrastructure. The approach used in these fixed files can be applied to the remaining failing tests, as outlined in the Test Fix Progress Report.
