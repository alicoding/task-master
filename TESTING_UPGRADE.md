# Testing Framework Upgrade

This document summarizes the changes made to replace our custom test script with a proper industry-standard testing framework.

## Key Changes

1. **Framework Selection**: Migrated from custom test scripts and `uvu` to **Vitest**
   - Better TypeScript integration with ESM modules
   - Proper support for TypeScript imports with `.ts` extensions
   - Rich feature set including watch mode and coverage reporting

2. **Test Configuration**: Created proper configuration files
   - `vitest.config.ts` for main configuration
   - `vitest-simple.config.ts` for simplified testing

3. **Test Scripts**: Updated package.json scripts
   - `test`: Run all tests
   - `test:watch`: Run tests in watch mode
   - `test:coverage`: Run tests with coverage reporting
   - `test:single`: Run a specific test
   - `test:migrate`: Migrate legacy tests to Vitest

4. **TypeScript Integration**: Configured TypeScript module resolution
   - Support for imports with `.ts` extensions
   - Node.js experimental module resolution
   - Proper ESM support

5. **Migration Path**: Created tools for gradual migration
   - `vitest-adapter.ts`: Adapter for running uvu tests with Vitest
   - `scripts/migrate-to-vitest.js`: Script to convert uvu tests to Vitest
   - Legacy test scripts preserved for backward compatibility

## Benefits

1. **Industry Standards**: Using an established, well-maintained testing framework
2. **Better Developer Experience**: Rich features, faster execution, and better error messages
3. **TypeScript Support**: Native TypeScript support with proper module resolution
4. **Simplified Maintenance**: No need to maintain custom test scripts
5. **Improved Coverage**: Better test coverage reporting and visualization
6. **Watch Mode**: Faster development with test watch mode

## Future Improvements

1. **Complete Migration**: Gradually migrate all tests to pure Vitest format
2. **Enhanced Coverage**: Set coverage thresholds and goals
3. **Test CI Integration**: Configure CI to run tests and report coverage
4. **Further Test Automation**: Add more test helpers and utilities

## Instructions for Developers

1. **Running Tests**: Use `npm test` to run all tests
2. **Writing New Tests**: Follow the Vitest format for new tests
3. **Migrating Tests**: Use the migration script for existing tests
4. **Test Documentation**: See `test/README.md` for detailed instructions

## Conclusion

This upgrade significantly improves our testing infrastructure while maintaining compatibility with our TypeScript-only approach. We've moved from a custom, maintenance-heavy solution to an industry-standard testing framework that provides a richer set of features and better developer experience.
