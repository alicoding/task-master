# Session Summary - Task Master Improvements

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed NLP Service Module for ESM Compatibility

- Converted NLP factory.ts from CommonJS require() to ESM dynamic import() statements
- Created an ESM-compatible version of the NLP manager to handle module compatibility issues
- Added proper error handling for asynchronous module loading
- Fixed the repository search integration with the NLP service
- Implemented jaccardSimilarity function to ensure API compatibility

### 2. Enhanced Task Visualization

- Added distinct visual indicators for different relationship types:
  - Child tasks (↳)
  - Sequential dependent tasks (→)
  - Sibling related tasks (↔)
- Implemented color-coding for different relationship types
- Added a legend explaining relationship symbols
- Improved hierarchical display with proper indentation
- Added support for displaying dependencies in task details

### 3. Added Test Coverage for NLP Module

- Created comprehensive test suite for distance/similarity functions
- Added ESM-specific tests for factory module
- Implemented tests for different relationship types
- Fixed existing tests to handle async NLP service initialization

### 4. Updated Definition of Done Guidelines

- Restructured DoD standards into clear categories:
  - Code Quality Requirements
  - Testing Requirements
  - Functional Requirements
  - Documentation Requirements
- Added strict no-regression policy
- Added detailed module-specific guidelines
- Established clear implementation workflow

### 5. Fixed CLI Exit Issue

- Implemented proper cleanup of database connections
- Added a global connection registry for consistent resource management
- Created signal handlers for graceful termination
- Added explicit process exit calls after command completion
- Fixed hanging issues in show and graph commands

### 6. Implemented Continuous Task Processing Workflow

- Created a systematic task processing workflow
- Added prioritization of tasks based on metadata, tags, and hierarchy
- Implemented automatic status transitions (draft -> ready -> in-progress -> done)
- Created test-driven development framework for new tasks
- Added shell script wrapper for reliable execution

## Remaining Issues

1. **Performance**: The CLI commands (show and graph) are now functional but could be further optimized for speed.

2. **Failing Tests**: Some tests are still failing for search functionality and graph visualization. These need to be addressed with additional fixes.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Optimize Performance**:
   - Profile the NLP services to identify bottlenecks
   - Implement caching for common operations
   - Consider lazy loading for less-used components

2. **Fix Graph Visualization Tests**:
   - Investigate issues with the graph visualization tests
   - Ensure compatibility with both new and old formatting

3. **Fix Repository Tests**:
   - Address the success/data handling in search results
   - Ensure compatibility with both legacy and modern patterns

4. **Implement High-Priority Tasks**:
   - Use the continuous task processor to work through the backlog
   - Focus on Task-Code Relationship Tracker features (task #17)
   - Follow TDD approach for all new implementations
   - Run the processor with `./scripts/process-tasks.sh`

## Using the Continuous Task Processor

To process tasks in the backlog systematically:

1. Run the task processor script:
   ```
   ./scripts/process-tasks.sh
   ```

2. The processor will:
   - First complete all in-progress tasks
   - Then implement ready tasks by setting them to in-progress and completing them
   - Finally refine draft tasks by setting them to ready

3. Each task is processed following strict DoD requirements:
   - Tests are written first
   - Implementation follows TDD principles
   - All TypeScript errors are fixed
   - ESM compatibility is maintained
   - Proper documentation is added
