# Test Infrastructure Fix Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the database schema issues in tests while maintaining the TypeScript-only imports implementation.

## Key Issues Fixed

1. **Database Schema Mismatch**:
   - Tests were failing with "table tasks has no column named description" errors
   - The in-memory database schema needed to be updated to match the current schema with description and body columns

2. **SQL Error in TaskHierarchyRepository**:
   - Fixed SQL query error "no such column: '.'" by properly using single quotes for the literal dot character
   - Updated: `"SELECT MAX(CAST(SUBSTR(id, INSTR(id, '.') + 1) AS INTEGER)) as max_child_num FROM tasks..."`

3. **Repository Method Implementations**:
   - Added missing implementation of `getChildTasks()` in the TaskHierarchyRepository
   - Fixed the return types of repository methods to properly handle TaskOperationResult

4. **Test Adaptations**:
   - Updated tests to handle the TaskOperationResult pattern
   - Adjusted test assertions for the new result structure

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/ali/tm/task-master/db/init.ts`:
   - Added description and body columns to the initial schema creation

2. `/Users/ali/tm/task-master/db/migrate.ts`:
   - Updated the migration files list to include all current migrations

3. `/Users/ali/tm/task-master/core/repository/creation.ts`:
   - Fixed SQL query for child task ID generation with proper escaping of dot character

4. `/Users/ali/tm/task-master/core/repository/hierarchy.ts`:
   - Added implementation for the missing getChildTasks method

5. `/Users/ali/tm/task-master/core/repository/index.ts`:
   - Fixed method implementations to handle TaskOperationResult properly

6. `/Users/ali/tm/task-master/test/commands/add-command.test.ts`:
   - Updated to use the test helper for database creation
   - Adjusted assertions to handle TaskOperationResult

## Verification

All tests in the selected test files now pass successfully, demonstrating that:

1. TypeScript import resolution works correctly with `.ts` extensions
2. Database schema includes all required columns (description, body)
3. Repository methods correctly handle the TaskOperationResult pattern
4. SQLite queries have proper escaping for special characters

This implementation successfully maintains the TypeScript-only approach while fixing the database schema issues in tests.
