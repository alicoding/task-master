/**
 * Continuous Task Processor
 *
 * This script implements a continuous workflow to systematically process
 * tasks in the Task Master backlog following strict DoD requirements.
 *
 * Workflow:
 * 1. Find in-progress tasks and complete them
 * 2. Find TODO ready tasks, set them to in-progress, and implement them
 * 3. Find TODO draft tasks, refine them, and move them to ready state
 *
 * Each task is fully implemented before moving to the next one, following
 * strict Test-Driven Development practices and Definition of Done requirements.
