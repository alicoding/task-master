# Task 17.5 Implementation Summary

## Task Description
Implement an Analysis Engine for the Task-Code Relationship Tracker (Task 17 series) that analyzes file content to find relationships with tasks.

## Implementation Details

### Key Files Created/Modified
1. **`core/daemon/analysis-engine.ts`**
   - Implemented the core Analysis Engine with task ID extraction, confidence scoring, and relationship type determination
   - Added file type classification and path analysis
   - Integrated NLP-enhanced analysis for improved matching
   - Added exclusion pattern support and extension filtering

2. **`test/core/analysis-engine.vitest.ts`**
   - Created comprehensive test suite with 8 tests covering all main functionality
   - Tests for task ID extraction, confidence scoring, relationship types, file paths, etc.
   - Includes proper mocking of dependencies

3. **`core/daemon/file-tracking-daemon.ts`**
   - Updated to integrate with the Analysis Engine
   - Added proper initialization and configuration
   - Modified event handling to use the engine for analysis
   - Updated tryAutoAssociateTasks to work with the engine

4. **`examples/analysis-engine-test.ts`**
   - Created example code showing how to use the Analysis Engine
   - Demonstrates task ID extraction and relationship types

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Task ID Detection**
   - Regular expression patterns for finding task references (Task-123, #123)
   - Support for extracting task IDs from both content and file paths
   - Location tracking for matches with line and column numbers

2. **Confidence Scoring**
   - Sophisticated scoring system for determining relationship strength
   - Context-aware confidence adjustment based on surrounding content
   - Threshold-based filtering to eliminate weak matches

3. **Relationship Type Classification**
   - Support for implements, tests, documents, and related relationship types
   - Automatic classification based on file type and context
   - File type detection based on extension and content

4. **File Tracking Integration**
   - Seamless integration with the existing File Tracking Daemon
   - Support for all file change events (create, modify, delete)
   - Batch operation support for efficient processing

5. **Configuration Options**
   - Configurable confidence threshold
   - File extension filtering
   - Path exclusion patterns
   - NLP enhancement options

### Testing
- Created a comprehensive test suite covering all main functionality
- 8 tests with proper mocking of dependencies
- Tests for extraction, confidence scoring, relationship types, etc.
- Example code demonstrating basic usage

## Completion Status
Task 17.5 is complete with all requirements implemented and tested. The Analysis Engine successfully extracts task IDs from file content, calculates confidence scores, determines relationship types, and integrates with the File Tracking Daemon.

## Next Steps
1. Enhance NLP integration for better matching of task descriptions
2. Add support for more file types and patterns
3. Optimize performance for large repositories
4. Add user interface for reviewing and managing task-code relationships
