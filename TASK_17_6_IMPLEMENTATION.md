# Task 17.6 Implementation Summary

## Task Description

Implement a File Change Analyzer component that extracts rich metadata from file changes, going beyond the task relationship tracking provided by the Analysis Engine (Task 17.5).

## Implementation Details

1. **`core/daemon/file-change-analyzer.ts`** (New)
   - Created comprehensive file change analysis functionality
   - Implemented code complexity metrics calculation
   - Added structural change detection for functions and classes
   - Included diff statistics computation
   - Implemented file type and language detection
   - Added keyword extraction for content understanding

2. **`test/core/file-change-analyzer.vitest.ts`** (New)
   - Comprehensive test suite with 8 tests
   - Tests for all main functionality
   - Various edge cases and configuration options

3. **`core/daemon/file-tracking-daemon.ts`** (Modified)
   - Integrated File Change Analyzer with daemon
   - Added analyzer initialization and configuration
   - Enhanced file processing with metadata extraction
   - Added events for file analysis results

4. **`docs/FILE_CHANGE_ANALYZER.md`** (New)
   - Detailed documentation of the implementation
   - Architecture overview
   - Usage examples
   - Future enhancements

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Code Complexity Analysis
- Lines of code calculation
- Function and class counting
- Cyclomatic complexity estimation
- Maintainability index calculation

```typescript
private calculateComplexityMetrics(content: string, language: string): CodeComplexityMetrics {
  // Count lines of code (excluding empty lines and comments)
  const linesOfCode = /* implementation */;
  
  // Count functions and calculate complexity
  const functionCount = /* implementation */;
  const classCount = /* implementation */;
  const cyclomaticComplexity = /* implementation */;
  
  return {
    linesOfCode,
    functionCount,
    classCount,
    cyclomaticComplexity,
    maintainabilityIndex
  };
}
```

#### 2. Structural Change Detection
- Function and class extraction from code
- Added, modified, and removed elements detection
- Content comparison between versions

```typescript
private analyzeStructuralChanges(
  newContent: string, 
  oldContent: string,
  language: string
): StructuralChangeInfo {
  // Extract structures from both versions
  // Compare and categorize changes
  return {
    addedFunctions, modifiedFunctions, removedFunctions,
    addedClasses, modifiedClasses, removedClasses
  };
}
```

#### 3. Diff Statistics Computation
- Line-by-line comparison between versions
- Added, removed, and modified line counting
- Change percentage calculation

#### 4. File Metadata Extraction
- File type determination (source, test, documentation, etc.)
- Programming language detection
- Keyword extraction from content

#### 5. Daemon Integration
- Configuration options for the analyzer
- Analysis results stored as file metadata
- Events for file analysis notifications

### Configuration Options

The File Change Analyzer supports various configuration options:

```typescript
export interface FileChangeAnalyzerConfig {
  // File extensions to analyze
  fileExtensions: string[];
  
  // Patterns to exclude from analysis
  excludePatterns: string[];
  
  // Feature toggles
  calculateComplexity: boolean;
  trackStructuralChanges: boolean;
  computeDiffStats: boolean;
  
  // Performance settings
  maxFileSize: number;
}
```

### Testing Coverage

The test suite covers all major functionality:

1. Basic file analysis
2. Structural change detection
3. Diff statistics calculation
4. Configuration options
5. Language and file type detection
6. Keyword extraction
7. Batch processing
8. Error handling

## Integration with Existing System

The File Change Analyzer is fully integrated with the file tracking system:

1. **File Tracking Daemon**
   - Automatically initializes the analyzer with appropriate configuration
   - Processes file changes through the analyzer
   - Stores analysis results as file metadata

2. **Database Storage**
   - Analysis results stored in the file metadata field
   - Structured JSON format for easy retrieval

3. **Event System**
   - New 'fileAnalyzed' event for analysis notifications
   - Includes analysis timestamp and metadata

## Completion Status

Task 17.6 is complete with all requirements implemented and tested. The File Change Analyzer greatly enhances the Task Master CLI's file tracking capabilities by providing deep insights into code quality, complexity, and changes over time.

## Follow-up Tasks

The next tasks in the Task 17 series are:

1. Task 17.7: Terminal Integration (Next in line)
2. Task 17.8: Session Recovery
3. Task 17.9: AI Prompt System
4. Task 17.10: Multi-Session Support
