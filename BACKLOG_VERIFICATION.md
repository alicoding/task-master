### Key Features Coverage
All requested features have been included in the backlog:

1. **Multi-Session Support** ✓
   - Task 17.10 and its subtasks (17.10.1 - 17.10.4)
   - Includes file claiming, conflict resolution, and priority systems

2. **Terminal Independence Features** ✓
   - Process detachment in task 17.1.1
   - Reconnection mechanism in task 17.7.2
   - Shell integration in task 17.4.3 and 17.7.3

3. **Database Efficiency Measures** ✓
   - Task 17.11 and its subtasks (17.11.1 - 17.11.3)
   - Includes cleanup policies, indexing strategies, and query optimization

4. **AI Prompt Customization with Cost Controls** ✓
   - Task 17.9 and its subtasks, particularly:
   - Cost Controls (17.9.4)
   - Caching System (17.9.5)
   - Usage Analytics (17.9.6)

5. **Task Hierarchy Management** ✓
   - Task 17.12 and its subtasks (17.12.1 - 17.12.4)
   - Includes auto-positioning, task renumbering, reference updates, and gap analysis

### Implementation Phase Alignment
The dependencies between tasks have been set to ensure proper implementation phases:

1. **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
   - 17.1 → 17.2 → 17.3

2. **Phase 2: Analysis Engine**
   - 17.3 → 17.5 → 17.6
   - 17.5 → 17.12

3. **Phase 3: Terminal Management**
   - 17.1 → 17.7 → 17.8 → 17.10 → 17.13

4. **Phase 4: Performance and AI Integration**
   - 17.3 → 17.11
   - 17.9 (independent but before CLI)

5. **Phase 5: CLI Integration**
   - 17.11 → 17.4
   - 17.12 → 17.4
   - 17.13 → 17.4
   - 17.9 → 17.4

## Conclusion

The Task Master backlog has been successfully updated with all 58 tasks required for implementing the Task-Code Relationship Tracking System. The tasks have been organized into a logical hierarchy with appropriate parent-child relationships and dependencies between components.

The implementation phases are properly reflected in the task dependencies, ensuring that the team can follow the planned implementation approach. All the requested features (multi-session support, terminal independence, database efficiency, AI cost controls, and task hierarchy management) have been included with detailed subtasks.

The team can now begin implementation according to the outlined plan, starting with the core infrastructure components.
